FAQ
===
**How do I contact the team?**   
Come join our [Discord guild](https://discord.gg/Q24TRnx)! All the current devs chill within there, and we are able to provide support.   
If you prefer to use IRC, you can join [#Tropicraft on EsperNet](https://webchat.esper.net/?nick=Tropi....&channels=tropicraft). However, Discord is more likely to be successful.   

**Can I use Tropicraft in my public/private mod pack?**   
Most likely! Find Cojo on Discord or IRC to receive permission and find out what is required from you.

Love Tropics
===
Love Tropics is a weekend-long charity livestream ran by the Tropicraft Dev Team and the Tropibros, focused on raising funds to help rebuild Puerto Rico.

In 2017 we raised $10,155USD for Direct Relief to help with medical supplies and aid, and in 2018 we raised $35,255.46USD for Team Rubicon to help put roofs back onto houses. This year we have bigger and better things planned, so keep your eyes peeled!
